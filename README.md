Hibernate requires to know in advance â€” where to find the mapping information that defines how your Java classes relate to the database tables. Hibernate also requires a set of configuration settings related to database and other related parameters. All such information is usually supplied as a standard Java properties file called hibernate.properties, or as an XML file named hibernate.cfg.xml.
So we have two entities that mapped by resources. We can also put the database in "update" or "create" position.
